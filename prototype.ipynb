    "The CV presents a mix of relevant and irrelevant experiences, which dilutes its effectiveness for a full-stack developer position. While Daniel has a background in system analysis and development, the majority of his work experience is in warehouse operations and customer service, which does not directly relate to the desired role. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- **Education:** The degree in System Analysis and Development is relevant to the full-stack developer role.\n",
    "- **Skills:** The inclusion of technical skills such as RESTful APIs design and database management is a positive aspect.\n",
    "- **Languages:** Proficiency in multiple languages can be an asset in diverse work environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses:**\n",
    "- **Irrelevant Experience:** The majority of the work history focuses on warehouse and customer service roles, which do not showcase full-stack development skills.\n",
    "- **Lack of Technical Projects:** There are no mentions of personal or professional projects that demonstrate full-stack development capabilities.\n",
    "- **Formatting Issues:** The CV lacks clear section headings and a structured format, making it difficult to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n",
    "1. **Highlight Relevant Experience:** Focus on any projects or roles that involved full-stack development, even if they were part-time or freelance.\n",
    "2. **Include Technical Projects:** Add a section for personal projects or contributions to open-source projects that demonstrate coding skills.\n",
    "3. **Improve Formatting:** Use clear headings for sections (Education, Skills, Experience) and bullet points for easier readability.\n",
    "4. **Tailor the CV:** Customize the CV for each application to emphasize the most relevant skills and experiences for the specific job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while Daniel has a solid educational background and some relevant skills, the lack of direct experience in full-stack development and the presence of unrelated work history significantly impact the CV's effectiveness. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Reasoning:**\n",
    "The CV presents a mix of relevant and irrelevant experiences, which dilutes its effectiveness for a full-stack developer position. While Daniel has a background in system analysis and development, the majority of his work experience is in warehouse operations and customer service, which does not directly relate to the desired role. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- **Education:** The degree in System Analysis and Development is relevant to the full-stack developer role.\n",
    "- **Skills:** The inclusion of technical skills such as RESTful APIs design and database management is a positive aspect.\n",
    "- **Languages:** Proficiency in multiple languages can be an asset in diverse work environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses:**\n",
    "- **Irrelevant Experience:** The majority of the work history focuses on warehouse and customer service roles, which do not showcase full-stack development skills.\n",
    "- **Lack of Technical Projects:** There are no mentions of personal or professional projects that demonstrate full-stack development capabilities.\n",
    "- **Formatting Issues:** The CV lacks clear section headings and a structured format, making it difficult to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n",
    "1. **Highlight Relevant Experience:** Focus on any projects or roles that involved full-stack development, even if they were part-time or freelance.\n",
    "2. **Include Technical Projects:** Add a section for personal projects or contributions to open-source projects that demonstrate coding skills.\n",
    "3. **Improve Formatting:** Use clear headings for sections (Education, Skills, Experience) and bullet points for easier readability.\n",
    "4. **Tailor the CV:** Customize the CV for each application to emphasize the most relevant skills and experiences for the specific job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while Daniel has a solid educational background and some relevant skills, the lack of direct experience in full-stack development and the presence of unrelated work history significantly impact the CV's effectiveness. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Score: 5/10**\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------------------------- \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the cv review is good, it could benefit from a more summarized response, focusing on key strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "Moreover, a more structured format with clear headings for each section would enhance readability. Additionally, providing the response inside your model context would make it easier to follow.\n",
    "As a resume screening assistant, I will ensure to incorporate these suggestions in my analysis.\n",

      "Caitlin's CV is well-structured and presents relevant education and experience for a part-time care assistant role. The focus on her nursing studies and volunteer work with Age UK aligns well with the job she is seeking. However, the formatting issues and lack of specific achievements could be improved.\n",
