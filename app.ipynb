    "**Reasoning:**\n",
    "The CV presents a mix of relevant and irrelevant experiences, which dilutes its effectiveness for a full-stack developer position. While Daniel has a background in system analysis and development, the majority of his work experience is in warehouse operations and customer service, which does not directly relate to the desired role. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- **Education:** The degree in System Analysis and Development is relevant to the full-stack developer role.\n",
    "- **Skills:** The inclusion of technical skills such as RESTful APIs design and database management is a positive aspect.\n",
    "- **Languages:** Proficiency in multiple languages can be an asset in diverse work environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses:**\n",
    "- **Irrelevant Experience:** The majority of the work history focuses on warehouse and customer service roles, which do not showcase full-stack development skills.\n",
    "- **Lack of Technical Projects:** There are no mentions of personal or professional projects that demonstrate full-stack development capabilities.\n",
    "- **Formatting Issues:** The CV lacks clear section headings and a structured format, making it difficult to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n",
    "1. **Highlight Relevant Experience:** Focus on any projects or roles that involved full-stack development, even if they were part-time or freelance.\n",
    "2. **Include Technical Projects:** Add a section for personal projects or contributions to open-source projects that demonstrate coding skills.\n",
    "3. **Improve Formatting:** Use clear headings for sections (Education, Skills, Experience) and bullet points for easier readability.\n",
    "4. **Tailor the CV:** Customize the CV for each application to emphasize the most relevant skills and experiences for the specific job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while Daniel has a solid educational background and some relevant skills, the lack of direct experience in full-stack development and the presence of unrelated work history significantly impact the CV's effectiveness. \n",
